Augmented Reality Experiments
=============================

Here you can find 
Augmented Reality Examples using OpenCV 2.x  and OpenGL 2.x

For OpenGL 
i am using Glut


Build instructions are included in every example i ll be putting up.

To Run all the examples 
You need opencv 2.x  and opengl 2.x with freeGLUT installed.

Otherwise it will result in dependency issues.
